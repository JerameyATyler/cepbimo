    "In the study of psychoacoustics `the precedence effect`, sometimes referred to as the `law of first wavefront`, refers to the psychoacoustical phenomena in which two distinct sounds seperated by a sufficiently small time delay will be perceived by a listener as a single sound. This phenomena is experienced through the interaction of two variables, the `interaural time difference (ITD)` and the `interaural level difference (ILD)`. The `precedence effect` and by extension `ITD`s and `ILD`s influence a person's `sound source localization` ability. Due to the `precedence effect` sounds seperated by a small gap are perceived not just as occuring at the time but also the same location. "

    "The difference in time from when a sound is perceived in one ear compared to the other is called the `ITD`. As touched on above, when two sounds are seperated by a small gap they will be perceived as occuring at the same time and place. When the gap between the two sounds increases beyond the listener's `echo threshold` the two sounds will be perceived as occuring seperately in both time and space. Though many factors influence the `precedence effect` in many cases the it can be experienced when the time delay is between 2 - 50 ms [[Blauert, 97]](blauert-97)."
